The Bring Your Pet to Work Chrome Extension doesn't collect any information by itself. A given user may opt to submit one or more pictures of their pets to the app, which other users can then view. Please use caution when submitting pictures to not include any information you do not wish disclosed.

The submitted information remains on a private database and will not be sold or used for any purpose outside of the extension.

Any pets submissions may be removed from the app for any reason at all, including, but not limited to, containing material not considered appropriate for a work-sponsored app. Please use discretion when submitting pictures and information.

If for any reason, you would like a submission removed from the database, please contact me at rstarr@indeed.com and allow me 48 hours to remove it.

You may also use that email address to contact me with any questions, concerns, or comments related to the app.
